#==> icu4c
#icu4c is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
#because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).
#
#If you need to have icu4c first in your PATH run:
#  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#
#For compilers to find icu4c you may need to set:
#  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
#  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"
#
#For pkg-config to find icu4c you may need to set:
#  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"
#
#==> node
#Bash completion has been installed to:
#  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
